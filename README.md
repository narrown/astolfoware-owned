problems (there is A LOT of them):

shared:

terrible visuals (just inject it...)
chatgpt code (A LOT of chatgpt code)
terrible code/methods in general
uses VS2019 building tools (troons pc can't handle VS2022...)

TF2: 
ESP is super buggy,
projectile aimbot is comically bad,
hitscan crashes.

L4D2 (keep in mind this was a p2c):
no overprediction fix (in a p2c),
no autowall (in a p2c),
actually hideous nospread code (that barely works + a p2c),
it has a severe missing issue with some weapons (in a p2c).

there is more but i can't use this terrible cheat any longer

keep in mind nothing here is edited by me, this is how the cheats actually performed.

i have the TF2C dll but not it's source code, not worth putting it.
