shared:

terrible visuals (just inject it...)
chatgpt code (A LOT of chatgpt code)
terrible code/methods in general

TF2: 
ESP is super buggy,
projectile aimbot is comically bad,
hitscan crashes.

L4D2 (keep in mind this was a p2c):
no overprediction fix (in a p2c),
no autowall (in a p2c),
actually hideous nospread code (that barely works + a p2c),
it has a severe missing issue with some weapons (in a p2c).
